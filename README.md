## Overview of Project

How campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals using Kickstarter dataset

### Purpose
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

![Outcomes vs Launch](/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

This is an analytical report using Excel from Kickstart dataset.

This report is from a period of 2009 through 2017.

This report is built on count of successful vs failed vs cancelled outcomes during a certain month.

-	Most successful outcomes were campaigns that started in the Month of May and Jun, over 100 successful outcomes
-	December is the lowest successful campaigns with a less than 40 successful outcomes. 
-	The trends of failed is almost parallel to the successful campaigns
-	October has the highest failed outcomes
-	Jan and Mar have the lowest failed outcomes
-	Cancellations are consistent throughout the year

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

![Outcomes vs Goals](/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

This is an analytical report using Excel from Kickstart dataset.

This report is from a period of 2009 through 2017.

This report is built on percentage based on dollar amount ranges of goals for successful, failed, or cancelled outcomes.

-	Less than 1000 has the highest percentage of being successful for theater
-	then it decreases to 15000 - 19999, where it goes below the failed percentage
-	between 15000 through 350000 is where there is a higher percentage of failed compared to successful
-	Between 35000 through 40000 the line crosses again where there is a higher percentage of successful to failed.
-	over 45000 is where is the highest of percentage of failure is likely

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-	I had no issues or challenges in creating this analysis.
-	Potential difficulties would be that other categories could be added to the results if the wrong calculation was used to only sum the information needed. Could be avoided if checks were done during the setup to make sure the correct results were given.
## Results

-	What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-	Campaigns starting in December do not fare well in comparison to June.
-	Very little theater campaigns will be a cancellation

-	What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-	There is a good spot between 3500 to 4500 for plays if they want donors to pledge for a high-cost production. Anything amounts over or lower will have a higher chances of failing, unless they can make the production under 2000.

-	What are some limitations of this dataset? 

-	There isn't a reason how they sought out pledgers.  Some campaigns could have been more aggressive that others in seeking pledges. Those that were not, is that the reason they failed or cancel.

-	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 
-	Other graphs would be to compare plays to another musicals or spaces on the outcomes or compare theatre to all other Kickstarter programs to see how that plays out.
